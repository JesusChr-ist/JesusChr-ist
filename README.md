STOOPID is an acronym for Stood Together Organically Organized to Provide Illinois Development and the branding, StOOpid, is a tip of the hat to the fact that while 
StOOpid.org aims to facilitate and foster communication in the name of improving Illinois' Communities & Cultures; the true, real path to prosperity is now and always 
has been COMMUNICATIon and that AI can both nourish and accelerate the development of technological, environmental, and societal issues to the benefit of every part of
The State of Illinois.

In the short term, we are focused on Kendall County, IL while we get the ball rolling as a whole. However, with several websites in the StOOpid.org network, our current 
primary focus is on the development of our site, JesusChr.ist and especially its Prayerport feature.
